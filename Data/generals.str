"Scouting is quite important. It helps determine which tactic should be used. Put scouts in front of your defenses. They will warn you about enemy attack in time. Move scouts in front of your attack force. They will warn you about danger. Don't forget that many scouts detect different types of stealth units. Detection capabilities are explained in unit descriptions. Read them attentively and use scouts properly."

Salvage parts can be also created by Jarmen Kell and Salvage Drop general's power."

ACADEMY:trydragselectingunits
"Many new players like to use shapeless heaps of tanks or other units and don't care about losses. It is a bad idea for Contra. Each lost unit gives experience to your enemy. Enemy gains next rank faster. Next rank unlocks new technologies for him and allows to produce more powerful units. Spare your units, use them carefully, don't allow enemy to get experience."

"Super weapons are absolute means of destruction because it is impossible to defend from them. But they are expensive and reload for a long time. They can also be destroyed by airstrikes, general's powers and other super weapons. When you build super weapons, you get opportunity to destroy your enemy with ease but risk to lose both time and money without reaching any goals."

"Managing a large army can be a bit unruly sometimes. One way to manage lots of units easily is by creating a \"control group\". Simply select the group of units in question and press \"Ctrl\" & a number at the same time. Now anytime you press this number, the group of units will be selected. Tap the number twice quickly and the camera view will center over the group."

"General, acquiring supplies later in a mission can be difficult. Each faction has a unique way to gain funds during long battles. China can build Hackers and an Internet Center. You can direct the Hackers to hack the internet for funds anywhere or just send them inside Internet Center to gain money even quicker. The GLA depends on the Black Market and the USA relies on the Supply Drop. If you don't plan ahead, you may have shortages."

ACADEMY:useselectionhotkeys
"General, hotkeys are a great way to enhance your control of your forces. \"E\" will select all units of the same type on the view screen. If you tap \"E\" twice quickly, it will select all units of the same type across the entire battlefield. \"Q\" will select all your combat units on the map. \"W\" will select all your air units on the map. Give them a try, they'll help you out."

ACADEMY:usetunnelnetwork
"When it comes to the GLA sneaking around the battlefield is their calling card. Tunnel Networks offer defense capabilities but they also allow the player to move around quickly. Simply build a few Tunnel Networks and send your units inside. Click on the structure and you can expel them from any other Tunnel Network anywhere on the map. They are key to the overall GLA strategy."
